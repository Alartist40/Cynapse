### Inspiration
*   **Frank Niu (OpenCode)**:
    *   The minimalist, command-palette driven TUI design of v3.0.0 is heavily inspired by Frank Niu's OpenCode project.
    *   The "Lead Agent + Subagent" architecture mirrors the patterns demonstrated in his work.
*   **Anthropic (Claude)**:
    *   **Constitutional AI**: The concept of an immutable "Core Values" layer is derived from Anthropic's research on Constitutional AI.
    *   **Artifacts**: The UI pattern of separating chat from working documents (artifacts) is inspired by Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

### Open Source Libraries
Cynapse is built on the shoulders of giants:
*   **Go**: The performance-first core language.
*   **Charmbracelet (Bubble Tea, Lipgloss)**: The declarative terminal ecosystem.
*   **SQLite / go-sqlite3**: Efficient workflow and persistence storage.
*   **Python**: The research and AI foundation.
*   **Transformers / PyTorch**: For neural operation.
*   **Llama.cpp / Ollama**: For local LLM orchestration.
*   **Cryptography**: For robust encryption standards.

### Community
Special thanks to the open-source privacy and security community for testing and feedback.
