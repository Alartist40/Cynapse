### Inspiration
*   **Frank Niu (OpenCode)**:
    *   The minimalist, command-palette driven TUI design of v3.0.0 is heavily inspired by Frank Niu's OpenCode project.
    *   The "Lead Agent + Subagent" architecture mirrors the patterns demonstrated in his work.
*   **Anthropic (Claude)**:
    *   **Constitutional AI**: The concept of an immutable "Core Values" layer is derived from Anthropic's research on Constitutional AI.
    *   **Artifacts**: The UI pattern of separating chat from working documents (artifacts) is inspired by Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

### Open Source Libraries
Cynapse is built on the shoulders of giants:
*   **Python**: The foundation.
*   **PyTorch**: For tensor operations.
*   **Llama.cpp**: For local LLM inference.
*   **Ollama**: For easy model management.
*   **Cryptography**: For robust encryption standards.
*   **Rich / Textual**: Inspiration for terminal UI components.

### Community
Special thanks to the open-source privacy and security community for testing and feedback.
